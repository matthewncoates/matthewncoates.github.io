I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in Philosophy, focusing on PPEL (Philosophy, Politics, Economics and Law), at Bowling Green State University, Ohio. I previously received my Ph.D in Philosophy in the Logic and Philosophy of Science department at University of California, Irvine.

I work in PPE. My main research interests are in computational philosophy and evolutionary game theory. I have a particular focus on network epistemology, a branch of formal social epistemology that investigates how networks of agents gather and share information. My dissertation used network modeling tools and game theory to study areas in network epistemology and the evolution of human moral behavior.

I am also interested in science and policy, the philosophy of economics, the philosophy of biology, and in the history of early analytic philosophy. This latter interest is mostly focused on the work of the economist John Maynard Keynes, including his philosophy of probability and his interactions with philosophers such as Russell, Moore and Wittgenstein.

In my spare time, I enjoy birding and bird photography.
